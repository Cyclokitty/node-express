### Basic Node App Using Express

**How To:**
- create app.js, README.md, .gitignore files in your project folder
-  in terminal 'npm init' and enter thru the file creation questions (add your name, always show off your work).
-  'npm install express --save' and this will save it as a dependency
- in the .gitignore file type 'node_modules' to avoid bulking up the uploading to github
- begin your app in app.js
